a = 2

a = 2

a = 6

print(a + a + a)

# Explanation: 

# The script would output 18  in the command line. Below is the explanation. 
# Since Python reads and executes scripts from top to bottom, variable a  will be updated in every line until line 3 where a  finally gets the value of 6 . 
# Then the print function prints out 6 + 6 + 6  which is 18 .
